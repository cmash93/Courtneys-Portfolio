# Courtney's Portfolio

## What I did:  
* I built my website using semantic html and CSS. I spent a lot of time experimenting with flexboxes, grids, and other display options. I really learned a lot from building my website from the ground up instead of using a template. I want to do a lot more in the future with this portfolio, but am happy at what all I accomplished in the past week.
* I learned and implemented many CSS elements through the use of semantic html as well as div blocks. There was a large emphasis on positioning, sizing, and formatting. It's crazy how the flexbox display can completely change the behavior of a container. Even small adjustments to padding or margins made a big difference. 
* To make my website responsive, I used several resources. I found that using rem instead of px made my website much more flexible. I also tried using percentages as much as I could and tried to mostly stay away from pixel values. Flex boxes also made this easier. 
* Beyond that, I used media queries to get my page to behave in specific ways when the browser reaches a certain pixel width. Luckily, by using what I mentioned previously, I didn't have to actually apply a media query until the page reached 540px.
